# **Heart Disease Prediction**
# **Overview**
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the likelihood of heart disease using patient data. The project applies various data science techniques to preprocess, analyze, and model the data, leveraging machine learning algorithms to make accurate predictions.
#
# **Background**
As a Mechanical Engineer with a keen interest in Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science (DS), I am exploring predictive modeling within the healthcare domain. By working on this heart disease prediction model, I aim to understand how data-driven approaches can support early detection and intervention for health-related issues, applying my technical skills to improve model accuracy and interpretability.

# **Project Structure**
**Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and handling of missing values, and encoding categorical features.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights into patterns and relationships in the data through visualizations.
**Feature Engineering**: Selection and transformation of features to improve model performance.
**Model Building and Evaluation**: Building classification models, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating model performance using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
**Technologies Used**
**Programming Languages**: Python
**Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
**ML Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and more
**Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy Score, F1 Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Classification Report
# **Goals**
**To accurately predict the risk of heart disease**: Using machine learning to develop models that can assist healthcare professionals in risk assessment.
**To apply engineering and data science methodologies**: Demonstrating the value of data science for meaningful applications outside of traditional engineering fields.
